# Circle Sensor Card v2 - WIP

A costum card for Home Assistant Lovelace to display sensor values as a circle.

This is a rewrite of the original [Circle Sensor Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/circle-sensor-card)
using the current best-practices [boilerplate template](https://github.com/custom-cards/boilerplate-card).
